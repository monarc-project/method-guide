MONARC is an iterative and qualitative method of risk analysis in four stages; broadly inspired by ISO/IEC 27005.

=== Iterative Method

MONARC uses an iterative method which enables the pragmatic progression of risk management. As recommended by ISO 27005, this method allows the user to focus on the essentials initially and then perform successive iterations to expand or refine the scope, addressing more technical aspects as needed. The toolâ€™s optimized risk models, provided as standard, support this type of risk management.

1. `Context establishment`: Definition of the target of the risk analysis, establishing and describing the context, defining the risk analysis criteria and the structure of the risk approach.
2. `Context modelling`: Development phase of the risk model. Once the primary assets have been identified, they should be broken down into support assets based on priority. The most common assets are available in the MONARC knowledge base, enabling default risk identification. This type of identification may be sufficient in an initial risk iteration; however, it is the responsibility of the risk expert to provide the comprehensive model.
3. `Evaluation and treatment of risks`: Risk assessment involves establishing the level of threats and vulnerabilities of the context type under review. The processing of risk entails proposing security measures which tend to lower major risks to acceptable levels and to accept low risks.
4. `Implementation and monitoring`: The current MONARC version provides follow-up views in terms of the implementation of recommendations. Monitoring involves regularly reviewing significant changes within the risk analysis context, as well as any major external changes that might necessitate a redesign of the analysis iteration.

=== Qualitative method

MONARC is a *Qualitative* method,

[NOTE]
===============================================
The risk parameters are determined on a contextual digital scale which enables the risks to be prioritised.
===============================================

This approach is based on ISO/IEC 27005, as it provides an easier framework for understanding non-tangible criteria related to impact and consequences, such as reputation, operational, and legal factors.

=== Access to methodology screens

Access to the views of the various stages of the method is provided by clicking on the numbers `1` to `4`, which are displayed under the Breadcrumbs in the main MONARC view.
The ISO/IEC 27005 processes are implemented via the views.
